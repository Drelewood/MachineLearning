Problem Statement

The New York City Taxi & Limousine Commission (TLC) has provided a data of trips made by the taxis in the New York city. The detailed trip-level data is more than just a vast list of taxi pickup and drop off coordinates.

The records include fields capturing pick-up and drop-off dates/times, pick-up and drop-off locations (location coordinates of the starting and ending points), trip distances, itemized fares, rate types, payment types, and driver-reported passenger counts etc. You can download the data dictionary below.

By aggregating the aforementioned records this dataset was created that provides precise location coordinates for where the trip started and ended, timestamps for when the trip started and ended, plus a few other variables including fare amount, payment method, and distance travelled.
